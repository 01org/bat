.SH FILES
\fI/etc/asound.conf\fP (or whatever file the user specifies with the
\fB-f\fP flag) is used to store current mixer settings. There are two benefits
of using alsactl: first, alsactl doesn't force the user to
use any particular mixer app; second, alsactl knows about pretty much
everything alsa is capable of controlling, which the various mixers
(like \fBamixer\fP, \fBalsamixer\fP, or \fBxamixer\fP) might not.

The configuration file is generated automatically by running
\fBalsactl store\fP. Editing the configuration file by hand is
possible and may be necessary for some of the card-specific features
that aren't known by the mixer apps (e.g. automatic mic gain, digital
outputs, etc.).

.SH QUESTIONS!!!

There are some things in the asound.conf file that I don't
understand:

--What's the difference between "hardware mute" and "join mute"?

--What does "record-by-mute" do?

--What does "external-input" do?
