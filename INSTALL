			ALSA utils installation
			=======================

Installation
------------

For installation you can use these commands:

	./configure
	make install

If ./configure command complain that alsa-lib package isn't installed,
please, check if --prefix option is same for alsa-lib and alsa-utils
package. The configure script from alsa-utils package probably cannot find
header file asoundlib.h in $prefix/include/sys directory (usually in
/usr/include/sys directory).
