			ALSA utils installation
			=======================

Installation
------------

For installation you can use these commands:

	./configure
	make install

If ./configure command complain that alsa-lib package isn't installed,
please, check if --prefix option is same for alsa-lib and alsa-utils
package. The configure script from alsa-utils package probably cannot find
header file asoundlib.h in $prefix/include/sys directory (usually in
/usr/include/sys directory).

Compilation from CVS sources
----------------------------

You need also GNU packages automake and libtool installed in your system
to compile CVS sources of alsa-lib package.

For compilation you can use these commands:

	aclocal
	automake --foreign --copy --add-missing
	autoconf
	./configure
	make

The included cvscompile script does this job for you.

Note: Some automake packages have missing aclocal program. Use newer version
      in the case.
